A small web application built with **React** and **Firebase** to manage a fun "beer points" leaderboard for a local football tournament.  
Participants can see the leaderboard in real-time, and admins can add points (_pingas_) from a protected admin panel.

Originally developed in a couple of days as a request for a friend, this project also served as a hands-on opportunity to practice **React** development, **Firebase** integration, and responsive UI design.
